# UFOs

## Overview of the Project
-	The webpage that was created in Chapter 11 for Dana provided an analysis of the UFO sightings. However, the purpose of this analysis was to provide a more in-depth analysis of the UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Filters for the city, state, country and shape will also be added in this analysis.
## Results
-	With the new webpage created for the UFO sightings, here is the process on how to navigate through the webpage. Using the filter search criteria buttons on the lower left side of the webpage, you can enter specific dates, cities, states, countries and shape. Once you have filled in each filter criteria button, on the right hand side will pop up the results. For example if I chose the date 1/4/2010 the results on the right side will show a list of UFO sightings. But if I changed the city to Fresno, CA, there is only one UFO sighting that shows up.

## Summary
-	I think the one drawback from this new design is that, you can only search through the year 2010, no UFO sightings before or after that year. Two recommendations to better the webpage are:
o	Include an image for each UFO sighting so not only can they get a description of the sighting but a visual on what it looks like.
o	The filter criteria search bars and result box should be outlined with white lines to make the webpage look more clean and concise.
